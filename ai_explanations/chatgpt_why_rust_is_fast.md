The first assembly code (ASM_1) performs better than the second assembly code (ASM_2) due to several key optimizations implemented by the Rust compiler. These optimizations enhance the performance and efficiency of the Number Theoretic Transform (ntt) function on the ARM Cortex M4. Here is a detailed analysis of these optimizations:

### 1. Loop Unrolling
Loop unrolling is a technique where the compiler reduces the overhead of loop control by decreasing the number of iterations and increasing the loop body size. This allows for better utilization of the processor’s instruction pipeline.

**Example:**
In ASM_1, sequences of similar instructions are repeated multiple times within a single loop iteration, which suggests loop unrolling. This reduces the number of jumps and loop control instructions, leading to more efficient execution.

```assembly
.LBB1_3:
    ...
    blo .LBB1_3
    add.w r10, r0, #129
    cmp r0, #127
    ...
    blo .LBB1_1
    mov r4, r0
    movs r5, #0
    ...
    blo .LBB1_8
```

### 2. Instruction Scheduling
Instruction scheduling is an optimization where instructions are reordered to avoid pipeline stalls and make better use of CPU resources. By carefully scheduling instructions, the compiler can ensure that data dependencies are resolved without unnecessary delays.

**Example:**
In ASM_1, you can see instructions that are scheduled in a way to ensure that dependent instructions have their operands ready when needed.

```assembly
ldrsh.w r9, [r0, r1, lsl #1]
add.w r4, r10, #128
mov.w r0, #256
cmp.w r4, #256
it hi
movhi r0, r4
sub.w r2, r0, #128
adds r1, #1
str r1, [sp, #12]
```

### 3. Efficient Use of Registers
Efficient use of registers minimizes memory access, which is slower compared to register access. The Rust compiler makes extensive use of available registers to store frequently accessed variables, reducing the need for repeated memory accesses.

**Example:**
The use of registers like `r12`, `r8`, `r9`, `lr`, etc., in ASM_1 shows that the compiler keeps critical data in registers, reducing the overhead of loading/storing from/to memory.

```assembly
movw r9, #1
movw lr, #65535
movt r11, #65535
...
str.w r8, [sp, #516]
str.w r8, [sp, #478]
str.w r8, [sp, #456]
```

### 4. Inline Assembly Optimizations
Inline assembly allows the compiler to use highly optimized assembly instructions directly within the code, tailored for specific tasks. This can lead to more efficient code compared to the generic code generated by higher-level constructs.

**Example:**
The Rust code likely includes inline assembly optimizations that result in the efficient, low-level manipulation of data seen in ASM_1.

```assembly
mvn r8, #3328
mov.w r11, #256
movw r1, :lower16:.Lanon.e014a0186272dfb360e2d177b7b7066f.61
movt r1, :upper16:.Lanon.e014a0186272dfb360e2d177b7b7066f.61
```

### 5. Use of Specialized Instructions
The ARM Cortex M4 architecture has specialized instructions for certain operations. The Rust compiler takes advantage of these instructions, leading to more efficient execution of specific tasks.

**Example:**
Instructions like `smlabt` (signed multiply with accumulation) are utilized effectively in ASM_1, which is optimized for DSP (Digital Signal Processing) operations.

```assembly
smlabt r1, r8, r1, r5
...
mul r5, r5, r9
mul lr, r5, r0
```

### 6. Memory Access Optimization
Optimizing memory access patterns can significantly reduce the time spent waiting for memory operations to complete. The Rust compiler ensures that data is accessed in a way that minimizes cache misses and makes better use of the processor’s memory hierarchy.

**Example:**
In ASM_1, you see optimized memory access patterns with prefetching and aligned memory accesses, reducing latency.

```assembly
ldrsh.w r9, [r0, r1, lsl #1]
ldrh.w r5, [r12, r0, lsl #1]
...
strh.w r3, [r12, r0, lsl #1]
strh.w r1, [r6, #256]
```

### Conclusion
The combination of loop unrolling, instruction scheduling, efficient use of registers, inline assembly optimizations, use of specialized instructions, and memory access optimization makes the assembly code generated by the Rust compiler (ASM_1) more performant than that generated by the C compiler (ASM_2). These optimizations lead to better utilization of the ARM Cortex M4's capabilities, resulting in faster and more efficient execution of the Number Theoretic Transform function.
