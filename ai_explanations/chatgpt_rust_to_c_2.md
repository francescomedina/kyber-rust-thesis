To convert the given assembly code of the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) to C code, we first need to understand the operations performed by the assembly code. The assembly code sets up several constants and performs a series of operations related to the NTT.

Here is a step-by-step explanation and conversion of the given assembly code to C:

### Assembly Code Analysis

1. **Function Prologue:**
   - The function starts by saving the current stack frame and setting up a new one.
   - `push {r7, lr}`: Save `r7` and the link register (return address).
   - `mov r7, sp`: Set `r7` to point to the current stack pointer.
   - `sub.w sp, sp, #528`: Allocate 528 bytes on the stack for local variables.

2. **Setting Initial Values:**
   - Various registers (`r0`, `r1`, `r3`, etc.) are loaded with constants, which are then stored in specific stack locations. These constants include large numbers like `65535` and `131072`, and the addresses of other values in memory.
   - The constants appear to be used for polynomial coefficients and NTT parameters.

3. **NTT Computation Loop:**
   - The main loop (`LBB1_1` and following labels) performs the core NTT computations. It involves loading and storing values, performing multiplications and additions, and modular reductions.
   - The loop runs through the coefficients of the polynomial, applying the NTT algorithm.

### C Code Conversion

The C code for the NTT function will involve initializing arrays and variables, performing the NTT computation with nested loops, and handling modular arithmetic.

Here's the equivalent C code based on the given assembly:

```c
#include <stdint.h>

#define N 256
#define Q 62209  // Large prime number used in NTT
#define MOD 65536

// Function to perform modular multiplication
uint32_t mod_mult(uint32_t a, uint32_t b, uint32_t mod) {
    return (uint64_t)a * b % mod;
}

// Function to perform modular addition
uint32_t mod_add(uint32_t a, uint32_t b, uint32_t mod) {
    return (a + b) % mod;
}

// Function to perform modular subtraction
uint32_t mod_sub(uint32_t a, uint32_t b, uint32_t mod) {
    return (a + mod - b) % mod;
}

void ntt(uint32_t *a, uint32_t *root_powers) {
    uint32_t m, k, j, u, t, s;
    uint32_t n = N;
    uint32_t q = Q;
    uint32_t mod = MOD;

    for (m = n / 2; m >= 1; m /= 2) {
        for (k = 0; k < n; k += 2 * m) {
            for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                u = a[k + j];
                t = mod_mult(root_powers[m + j], a[k + j + m], q);
                a[k + j] = mod_add(u, t, q);
                a[k + j + m] = mod_sub(u, t, q);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    uint32_t a[N];
    uint32_t root_powers[N];

    // Initialize the polynomial coefficients and root powers
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        a[i] = i;  // Example initialization
        root_powers[i] = (i + 1) * 2;  // Example initialization
    }

    ntt(a, root_powers);

    // Output the transformed coefficients
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        printf("%u ", a[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - `mod_mult`, `mod_add`, and `mod_sub` functions handle modular arithmetic.
   - `ntt` function performs the Number Theoretic Transform.
   - `a` array holds the polynomial coefficients.
   - `root_powers` array holds the powers of the primitive root of unity used in the NTT.

2. **NTT Function:**
   - The outer loop iterates over the stages of the NTT.
   - The middle loop processes pairs of coefficients.
   - The inner loop performs the butterfly operation on pairs of coefficients using the root powers.

3. **Main Function:**
   - Initializes `a` and `root_powers` arrays with example values.
   - Calls the `ntt` function to transform the polynomial.
   - Prints the transformed coefficients.

This C code should provide a clear and functional equivalent to the given assembly code for the Number Theoretic Transform. Adjustments to the constants and specific details of the initialization may be needed based on the exact context and requirements of the original assembly implementation.
